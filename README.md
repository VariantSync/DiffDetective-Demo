# DiffDetective-Demo

A small demonstration of [DiffDetective](https://github.com/VariantSync/DiffDetective). 
The demo is a Java maven project, which includes DiffDetective as a library.

This demo comes with a screencast available on YouTube, guiding you through the demo's setup with Maven in IntelliJ and how to implement variability-aware differencing and analyses of Git histories:

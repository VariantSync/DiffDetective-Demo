# DiffDetective-Demo

A small demonstration of [DiffDetective](https://github.com/VariantSync/DiffDetective). The demo is a Java Maven project, which includes DiffDetective as a library.
You may run the demo manually, or by using Nix or Docker.
The manual setup enables you to use DiffDetective in any of your own Maven projects.
The Nix and Docker setups just build the demo for you to run it.

This demo comes with a screencast available on YouTube, guiding you through the demo's setup with Maven in IntelliJ and how to implement variability-aware differencing and analyses of Git histories:
